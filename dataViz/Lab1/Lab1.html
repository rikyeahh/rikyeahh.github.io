    <p>This lab is about comparing categories via bar plots and a waffle chart</p>

        <h2>Number of trees per species</h2>
        <p>This bar chart shows the number of trees for each species present in the municipality of Trento. Among all
            the 200 species of trees available we display only the 10 most aboundant types of trees. Hovering over the
            bars display additional information about the species: in particular we show the mean canopy cover of the
            specific tree species.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="viz-section">
        <h2>Stacked bar chart - Tree species per neighborhood</h2>
        <p>Each bar holds information about tree species for each neighborhood in Trento. Each species of the top 9 (+
            others) in the different neighborhoods is color-coded to the same color. Since comparing the same species
            across neighborhood can be tricky, hovering to see the exact amount can be very useful.</p>
        <div id="graph2"></div>
    </section>

    <section class="viz-section">
        <h2>Bar charts - small multiples</h2>
        <p>Small multiples of the 5 most popular trees, showing their distribution across neighborhoods. Note the
            different axes values: the same bar length across different neighborhood might represent different
            quantities, to preserve visual consistency (especially with the much more populated "other" class).</p>
        <div id="graph3"></div>
    </section>

    <section class="viz-section">
        <h2>Normalized stacked bar chart</h2>
        <p>Exactly like the stacked bar chart above, but here the quantities within each neighborhood are "normalized"
            to cover the same amount of space. In this way, we can compare the species of more populated neighborhoods
            (i.e. Centro Storico) to less populated neighborhoods in terms of percentage.</p>
        <div id="graph4"></div>
    </section>

    <section class="viz-section">
        <h2>Waffle chart</h2>
        <p>The type of data shown in this graph is exactly the same as the one above: percentages of tree species for
            each neighborhood. In this visualization, we "quantize" this quantities and show them as little blocks.
            Since the rounding may result in more/less than 100 blocks, we subtract/add the difference in the "Others"
            class</p>
